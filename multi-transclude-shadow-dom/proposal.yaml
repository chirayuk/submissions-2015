  Title: >
    Creating Container Components with Web Components and Angular
  Description: >
    So you've embraced architecting your Angular application with reusable 
    components--cheers to you!  But you have UI components that need multiple 
    entry points for user markup, and regular ng-transclude left you hanging.
    In this talk, we'll cover how new web component standards, like the 
    Shadow DOM, handle this.  Next, we'll walk through how to accomplish it 
    today in Angular 1.3 -- and also give you a brief glimpse into what a 
    solution will look like in upcoming Angular 2.
