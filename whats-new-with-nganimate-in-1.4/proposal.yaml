  Title: What's new with ngAnimate in 1.4
  Description: >
    AngularJS 1.4 will come packaged with a totally new refactor of ngAnimate. The
    animation platform is now much further broken down and there are some sweet new
    features we can get our hands on. Let's explore these new features and really see
    how far our sleek animated interfaces can go. Let's also explore what's in store
    for Angular 1.5 and 2.0.
