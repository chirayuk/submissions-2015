  Title: Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!
  Description: >
    Most people wait their entire life to get a badge granting them permission to be awesome.
    We would like to challenge that notion by telling you how one of the most popular Angular sites came to be.
    We are going reveal the exact playbook we used to build Plunker with Angular so that it could handle almost 20,000 unique visitors a day.
    We will also tell you how we did it in our spare time. 
    You don't need no stinkin' badges to be awesome!
