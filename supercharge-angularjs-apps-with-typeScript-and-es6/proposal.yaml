  Title: Supercharge Angular Apps with TypeScript and ES6
  Description: >
    ES6 offers many exciting features that will change how you write JavaScript and Angular applications. 
    But can you take advantage of ES6 features today while still supporting browsers that don’t fully implement ES6? 
    In this session you’ll learn about key features found in the TypeScript language (a superset of JavaScript) 
    and see how they can be used to add ES6-style code into your Angular apps. Topics covered include classes, 
    inheritance, types, generics, and more.
