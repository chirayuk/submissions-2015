  Title: Binding to the Cloud with Falcor
  Description: >
    Every user wants to believe that all of the data in the cloud is available locally on their device. Netflix's Falcor framework creates this illusion for the developer. Falcor allows you to model all of your cloud data sources as one virtual JSON object. "Falcor" allows you to code against your remote JSON model using the same APIs you would use on local JSON objects. With Falcor you can use simple JSON operations and path expressions to retrieve precisely the data your templates need. Imagine binding your templates directly to the cloud and letting Falcor take care of the network for you.

    We'll talk about how Falcor works, and how we're planning on taking advantage of Angular 2.0 extensibility to more tightly integrate the two frameworks.
